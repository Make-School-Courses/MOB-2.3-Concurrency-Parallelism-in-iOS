## Tools - Instruments üõ†

Instruments is a powerful performance analysis and testing tool. It comes with Xcode's toolset.

You can use it during:
- development
- testing
- debugging

It provides tools called **Instruments** that are used to profile errors in you app.

An **Instrument** collects data over a period of time.

## Time Profiler

Uses data provided by the operating system to collect call stacks of relevant threads at a fixed time interval.

**Why?**

- We can analyze an app's responsiveness and performance.


## Instruments walkthrough

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Track Viewer (top)
A track shows time series trace data corresponding to one source of events (such as a process, thread or CPU core)

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Detail view (bottom)
Explore trace data for a selected track. See the functions called on each thread during the trace.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Extended Detail View (right)
Provides richer info from the Instruments in use. (For example, for Time Profiler, we see the heaviest call stack)

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è Inspection Head
A selector placed at a specific time in the trace.Selects all traced events or intervals occurring at that time.

## Demo time üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

## Profiling Tips

- Time Profiler shows how your app is spending time
- Check main thread when responsiveness issues occur
- Profile with difficult workloads or older devices
- Instruments supports all platforms and the simulator. But watch out when using the simulator. üëÄ
- Gives you trends, are things getting faster or slower? Observes all the threads in your app at a fixed interval of time and correlates the information.

## Try it out

10 min - Take out an Xcode project (maybe your final project üòÄ) and run the Time Profiler. See if everything looks good so far.

## Unit Testing Asynchronous Operations

### Synchronous Operation Testing
Unit testing is most commonly applied to __*synchronous*__ operations because their outputs can be observed and validated immediately after invoking the function under test.

Whether the output is a function return value, a state change, or the result of methods invoked on a dependency, all of these results occur right away and in the same thread.

And, with __*synchronous*__ operations, when you write the assertions in the `Then` phase of your unit test, you are reasonably guaranteed that the outputs have already been set, so you can safely compare *actual* results against your *expected* ones.

Simple. Only one thread. And no worries that your outputs might not be set prior to test completion.

### Asynchronous Operation Testing
However, modern iOS development requires a great deal of __*asynchronous*__ operations in which results might not come immediately after a function is invoked.

__*Asynchronous*__ operations are operations that do not execute directly within the current flow of code. This might be because they run:
- on a different thread
- in a delegate method
- in a callback

Key examples:
- Networking (most common)
- Core Data
- Resource-expensive screen drawing code or events

Asynchronous operations are typically developed in one of two ways:
- Completion handler block
- Delegate method

Networking is the most common __*asynchronous*__ operation. Fetching data from remote web services has latency &mdash; it takes time to for signals to travel across the globe &mdash; and has many variables that can result in errors or delays.

<!-- The most common asynchronous operation is networking. Fetching data from an API over the network has latency, because data takes time to travel through wires around the globe. There can also be numerous points of failures. The server may be down. Packets can get dropped. Multiplexing can produce errors. Connection may be lost. There are many variables that can result in errors and/or delays.  -->

### Benefits & Challenges
Testing __*asynchronous*__ code comes with the benefit of uncovering poor design decisions and facilitating clean implementations.

The core challenge is that, in typical unit tests, a test is considered over as soon as its function returns.

With __*asynchronous*__ operations:
- Functions do not return their result to the caller immediately but deliver it later via callback functions, blocks, notifications, or similar mechanisms, which makes testing more difficult.
- When the function under test returns, any __*asynchronous*__ code will be ignored because it will run after the test has already finished.

This makes unit testing __*difficult*__ because results can be unpredictable: In the `Then` phase of your unit test, the results may or may not have been set to the outputs for you to observe and verify. When you write your assertions, the test may pass this time (if the outputs have been set), but fail at another time (if the outputs haven‚Äôt been set).

It can also result in __*false positives.*__

As a result, asynchronous testing requires special handling.

<!-- tasks might be executed on a different thread than the invoked function yet take extended time to complete before their outputs are set.

the program or information flow is not reflected in the call stack any more. -->

### Expectations
Fortunately, Xcode has built-in support to help with unit testing of __*asynchronous*__ operations.

To test that __*asynchronous*__ operations behave as expected, you create one or more **Expectations** within your test, and then __*fulfill*__ those expectations when the __*asynchronous*__ operation completes successfully.

Apple describes the `XCTestExpectation` class as "An expected outcome in an asynchronous test."

```Swift  
  class XCTestExpectation : NSObject
```

...and the `XCTestExpectation` class's `fulfill()` function is simply described as "Marks the expectation as having been met."


```Swift  
  func fulfill()
```

> Note that it is an error to call the `fulfill()` method on an expectation that has already been fulfilled, or when the test case that vended the expectation has already completed.


### Example Scenario
Steps required to unit test __*asynchronous*__ operations will vary depending on the function(s) under test.

In general, when using the `XCTestExpectation` class, your test method waits until all expectations are fulfilled or a specified timeout expires.

To illustrate a common scenario, here are the general steps you would execute to create a unit test for a background download task using an instance of the the `XCTestExpectation` class: <sup>1</sup>

1.  Create a new instance of `XCTestExpectation`.

2.  Use URLSession's `dataTask(with:)` method to create a background data task that executes your download work on a background thread.

3. After starting the data task, use the `wait(for expectations:_)` function of the `XCtest` class &mdash; with the timeout parameter that you specify &mdash; to set how long the main thread will wait for the expectation to be fulfilled.

```Swift
  /*!
   * @method -waitForExpectations:timeout:
   * Wait on a group of expectations for up to the specified timeout. May return early based on fulfillment
   * of the waited on expectations.
   */
  open func wait(for expectations: [XCTestExpectation], timeout seconds: TimeInterval)
```

4. When the data task completes, its `completion handler` verifies that the downloaded data is non-nil, and fulfills the expectation by calling its` fulfill()` method to indicate that the background task completed successfully.

#### Successful Completion
The fulfillment of the expectation on the background thread provides a point of synchronization to indicate that the background task is complete. As long as the background task fulfills the expectation within the duration specified in the timeout parameter, this test method will pass.

#### Unsuccessful Completion
There are two ways for the test to fail:
- The data returned to the completion handler is `nil`, causing `XCTAssertNotNil(_:_:file:line:)` to trigger a test failure.
- The data task does not call its completion handler before the timeout expires, perhaps because of a slow network connection or other data retrieval problem. As a result, the expectation is not fulfilled before the wait timeout expires, triggering a test failure.

<!--
The core of the problem is that a test is considered over as soon as its function returns. Because of that, any asynchronous code will be ignored, since it‚Äôll run after the test has already finished.
Not only can this make code hard to test, but it can also lead to false positives.


The main challenge of testing concurrent code is that the program or information flow is not reflected in the call stack any more. Functions do not return their result to the caller immediately, but deliver it later via callback functions, blocks, notifications, or similar mechanisms, which makes testing more difficult.


Asynchronous operations present a challenge to unit testing. In the Then phase, the results may or may not have been set to the outputs for you to observe and verify. When you write your assertions, the test may pass this time (if the outputs have been set), but fail at another time (if the outputs haven‚Äôt been set).

<!--
All the unit tests that you‚Äôve seen so far are for testing synchronous operations. That is, the outputs can be observed and verified immediately after invoking the method on the test subject. The outputs can be function return values, state changes, or methods invoked on a dependency. All of these happen right away in the same thread. When you write the assertions in the Then phase, you‚Äôre guaranteed that the outputs have already been set so that you can safely compare the actual v.s. expected. You don‚Äôt have to worry about whether the outputs are ready or not. They are ready.

However, a lot of stuff that we do in modern iOS development are asynchronous operations, such as Core Data, networking, or even some expensive drawing code or events. The results will come, but not right away. It takes time for the task to finish, and the outputs be set. In iOS, these asynchronous operations are usually coded in one of two ways:

Completion handler block
Delegate method

## In Class Activity I (60 min)

### Individually
In the [starter app](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/StarterApp-MOB-2.4-L10), a previous developer created a `testDownloadWebData()` function to unit test a background data task. However, that function is missing critical functionality.

Your task is to complete the `testDownloadWebData()` function so that it successfully validates its targeted background task.

1. Complete the Code

- find the `//TODO:`s left in the function and add or change whatever is needed (*see Example Scenario above for clues*)

2. Run the code and examine results

- What happened? Why?

3. Apply any additional required fixes

- Run it again...

4. Make it fail

Review the Successful and Unsuccessful Completion notes in the Example Scenario above.

- reduce timeout to 0.1
