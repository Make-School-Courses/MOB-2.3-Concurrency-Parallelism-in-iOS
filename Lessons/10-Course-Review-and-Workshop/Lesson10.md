## Testing Asynchronous Operations (10 min)


Asynchronous operations are operations that do not execute directly within the current flow of code. This might be because they run on a different thread, in a delegate method, or in a callback.


### Why this is difficult



### Expectations

To test that asynchronous operations behave as expected, you create one or more expectations within your test, and then fulfill those expectations when the asynchronous operation completes successfully.

Your test method waits until all expectations are fulfilled or a specified timeout expires.

### Steps




## In Class Activity I (60 min)
