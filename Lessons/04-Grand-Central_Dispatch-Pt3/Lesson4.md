### Creating Serial Queues

From our previous lesson, the example below illustrates how easy it is to create `DispatchQueues`.

Here, we create a new `DispatchQueue` called `myQueue` with a *label* (identifier) of `"com.makeschool.mycoolapp.networking"`:

```Swift
  let myQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.makeschool.mycoolapp.networking")
 ```
This example invokes the __*default initializer*__ for a `DispatchQueue`.

If you do not expressly define your `DispatchQueue` with the `.concurrent` attribute, GCD will __*by default*__ create a __*serial*__ queue (wherein each task must complete before the next task is able to start).

### Creating Concurrent Queues

It's just as easy to create a **concurrent**`DispatchQueue`.

To create a concurrent queue, pass the `.concurrent` attribute to your new queue:

```Swift
  let myQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.makeschool.mycoolapp.networking", attributes: .concurrent)
 ```

### QoS Priority Levels (Quick Review)

A `Quality of Service (QoS)` class categorizes work to be performed on a `DispatchQueue`.

Concurrent queues are so common that Apple has provided six different global concurrent queues, depending on the `Quality of Service (QoS)` the queue should have &mdash; four primary QoS classes and two special QoS classes.

If we look "under the hood", we can see all six QoS classes defined in the `QoSClass enum`:

![QoSClass_enum](assets/QoSClass_enum.png) </br>


When using a __*concurrent*__ dispatch queue, you'll need to tell GCD how important the tasks are that get sent to the queue so that it can properly prioritize execution of your task against all other tasks competing for resources.

By specifying a QoS to work, you indicate its importance, and the system prioritizes it and schedules it accordingly.

Remember that higher-priority work has to be performed faster, takes more system resources to complete, and requires more energy than lower-priority work.



Note: Global queues are always concurrent and first-in, first-out.


If you just need a concurrent queue but don't want to manage your own, you can use the global class method on DispatchQueue to get one of the pre-defined global queues:

let queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInteractive)

As mentioned above, Apple offers six quality of service classes:

Concurrent queues are so common that Apple has provided six different global concurrent queues, depending on the Quality of service (QoS) the queue should have.

When using a concurrent dispatch queue, you'll need to tell iOS how important the tasks are that get sent to the queue so that it can properly prioritize the work that needs to be done against all the other tasks that are clamoring for resources.

Remember that higher-priority work has to be performed faster, likely taking more system resources to complete and requiring more energy than lower-priority work.

If you just need a concurrent queue but don't want to manage your own, you can use the global class method on DispatchQueue to get one of the pre-defined global queues:

let queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInteractive)

As mentioned above, Apple offers six quality of service classes:

Special Quality of Service Classes

In addition to the primary QoS classes, there are two special types of QoS (described in Table 4-2). In most cases, you wonâ€™t be exposed to these classes, but there is still value in knowing they exist.

### Creating QoS priority

Need a concurrent queue but don't want to have to manage your own? Then just *use the global class method* on `DispatchQueue` to use one of the __*pre-defined global queues:*__

```Swift
  let queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInteractive)
 ```
But if you wish to create your own concurrent `DispatchQueue`, you can specify to the system your *target* QoS level is via its initializer:

```Swift
  let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.makeschool.mycoolapp.networking",
                          qos: .userInitiated,
                          attributes: .concurrent)
 ```

### Inferring QoS priority


Accurately specifying appropriate QoS classes for the work your app performs ensures that your app is responsive and energy efficient.



<!-- If you create your own concurrent dispatch queue, you can tell the system what the QoS is via its initializer:
However, this is like arguing with your spouse/kids/dogs/pet rock: Just because you say it doesn't make it so! The OS will pay attention to what type of tasks are being submitted to the queue and make changes as necessary.
If you submit a task with a higher quality of service than the queue has, the queue's level will increase. Not only that, but all the operations enqueued will also have their priority raised as well.

If the current context is the main thread, the inferred QoS is .userInitiated. You can specify a QoS yourself, but as soon as you'll add a task with a higher QoS, your queue's QoS service will be increased to match it.
let queue = DispatchQueue(label: label,
                          qos: .userInitiated,
                          attributes: .concurrent) -->

#### Custom Queues


#### Default Queues





#### Issues


<!-- TODO: introduce Thread Explosion? -->
 <!-- Many workitems submitted to global concurrent queue
 If workitems block, more threads will be created
 May lead to thread explosion -->


Another way that apps consume too many threads is by creating too many private concurrent dispatch queues. Because each dispatch queue consumes thread resources, creating additional concurrent dispatch queues exacerbates the thread consumption problem. Instead of creating private concurrent queues, submit tasks to one of the global concurrent dispatch queues. For serial tasks, set the target of your serial queue to one of the global concurrent queues. That way, you can maintain the serialized behavior of the queue while minimizing the number of separate queues creating threads.

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue


<!-- TODO: Ask questions:
- what would happen if the system (a) runs out of threads, and/or (b) creating too many queues? (hint: are queues limited by cores?)
 -->


 > Note &mdash; When designing tasks for concurrent execution, do not call methods that block the current thread of execution. When a task scheduled by a concurrent dispatch queue blocks a thread, the system creates additional threads to run other queued concurrent tasks. If too many tasks block, the system may run out of threads for your app.
