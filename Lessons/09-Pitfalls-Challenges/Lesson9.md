# Concurrency Pitfalls & Challenges

<!-- INSTRUCTOR NOTES:
1)  -->

## Why you should know this

Concurrency gives us many benefits when it comes to solving performance issues. Today we'll learn about the most well-known problems we can encounter if we are not being careful with our apps and how to solve them üòâ.

## Learning Objectives

1. Identify, describe, and propose solutions to the following concurrency challenges:
- **Race Conditions**
- **Priority Inversion**
2. Identify and describe how to use __*dispatch barriers*__ to alleviate issues caused by locks and semaphores


## Race conditions

Let's say we have a program that depends on the timing of one or more processes to function correctly.

If a thread runs or finishes at an unexpected time, it may cause unpredictable behavior:
 - incorrect output
 - program deadlock

Any situation where several processes access and manipulate shared data concurrently and where the result depends on timing of these processes, which are ‚Äúracing‚Äù is a **race condition**.

üåÄNote: **Thread-safe** is the term we use to describe a program, code, or data structure free of race conditions when accessed by multiple threads.

### An example

**Situation:** We have two threads executing and both of them are trying to update a `count` variable.

**Fact:** Reads and writes are separate tasks that the computer cannot execute in a single operation.

**What we do in each thread:** `count += 1`

**What really happens:**
1. We load the value of the variable `count` into memory.
1. We increment the value of `count` by one in memory.
1. We write the updated count back to disk.

(Whiteboard drawing + explaining)

**Result:** Race conditions lead to complicated debugging due to the non-deterministic characteristic of these scenarios.

**How can we solve it:** Serial queues üëçüèº

If we have a variable that needs to be accessed concurrently, we can wrap reads and writes in a serial queue.

```Swift
private let countQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "countqueue")
private var count = 0
public var count: Int {
  get {
    return countQueue.sync {
      count
    }
  }
  set {
    countQueue.sync {
      count = newValue
    }
  }
}
```

Here we are controlling the access to the variable an making sure that only a single thread at a time can access the variable.

**What's another solution you can think of?**

(Whiteboard drawing + explaining with locks)

### Thread barrier
Our previous solution is effective for simple situations. But there are times when the shared resource needs more complex logic. To make up for that we can use a solution from GCD, called **dispatch barrier**.

The main idea is that we create a concurrent queue where we can process all the read tasks we want, they can all run at the same time. But when the variable needs to be written to, then we lock the queue so that submitted tasks complete but no new submissions are run until the update is done.

(whiteboard diagram)

*Implementation*

```Swift
private let countQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "countqueue", attributes: .concurrent)
private var count = 0
public var count: Int {
  get {
    return countQueue.sync {
      count
    }
  }
  set {
    countQueue.async(flags: .barrier) { [unowned self] in
      self.count = newValue
    }
  }
}
```

## NSLock

An NSLock object implements a basic mutex for Cocoa applications. The interface for all locks is actually defined by the NSLocking protocol, which defines the **lock** and **unlock** methods. You use these methods to acquire and release the lock just as you would any mutex.

Check out [this example](https://github.com/evgenyneu/keychain-swift/blob/master/Sources/KeychainSwift.swift) from the library KeychainSwift and observe how they use locks.

## In Class-Activity I (10 min)

Take this code snippet into a playground and see what it does. What's wrong with it? What is the concurrency problem?

```Swift
var array = [Int]()

DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform(iterations: 100){ index in
    let last = array.last ?? 0
    array.append(last + 1)
    print(array)
}
```
Using NSLock, try to fix it. More info on what `concurrentPerform` does [in the docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue/2016088-concurrentperform).

## Priority Inversion

### General Example
In 1995, NASA sent the Pathfinder mission to Mars.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Sojourner_on_Mars_PIA01122](assets/Sojourner_on_Mars_PIA01122.png) </br>

Not too long after a successful landing on our red neighboring planet, the mission almost came to an abrupt end.

The Mars rover (Sojourner) kept rebooting for unknown reasons ‚Äì it suffered from a phenomenon called __*priority inversion*__.

Read more about what happened [here](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~risat/Report_MarsPathFinder.pdf).

### How it happens

The problem can occur when you have a high-priority and a low-priority task share a common resource:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![priority_inversion](assets/priority_inversion.png) </br>

- When the low-priority task takes a lock to the common resource, it is supposed to finish off quickly in order to release its lock and to let the high-priority task execute without significant delays.
- Since the high-priority task is blocked from running as long as the low-priority task has the lock, there is a window of opportunity for medium-priority tasks to run and to preempt the low-priority task, because the medium-priority tasks have now the highest priority of all currently runnable tasks.
- At this moment, the medium-priority tasks hinder the low-priority task from releasing its lock, therefore effectively gaining priority over the still waiting, high-priority tasks.


### Priority Inversion in iOS
Since GCD exposes background queues with different priorities, including one which even is I/O throttled, it‚Äôs good to know about this possibility.

Priority inversion most commonly occurs in iOS when a queue with a lower quality of service is given a higher system priority than a queue with a higher QoS.
- As a result, blocking, spinning, and polling may occur.

You may recall that the QoS of a Dispatch or an Operation Queue can be changed based on the QoS of the tasks which you, the developer, submit to it.

If you submit multiple tasks to a `.utility` queue with the higher-priority `.userInteractive` QoS,<sup>2</sup> the system could upgrade the QoS of that queue with a priority *higher* than that of a `.userInitiated` queue. Suddenly, all the tasks in the queue &mdash; most of which are really of the `.utility` QoS &mdash; will end up running before the tasks from the `.userInitiated` queue.

> <sup>2</sup> Remember your QoS levels:
> - `.userInteractive` &mdash; Tasks submitted to this queue should complete virtually instantaneously.
> - `.userInitiated` &mdash; Tasks performed in this queue should take a few seconds or less to complete.
> - `.utility` &mdash; Tasks can take a few seconds to a few minutes in this queue.
> - `.background` &mdash; Use this queue for work that will take significant time, minutes or more.


### How to avoid it
In the case of *synchronous* work, the system will try to resolve the priority inversion automatically by raising the QoS of the lower priority work for the duration of the inversion.<sup>1</sup>

But using multiple queues with different priorities adds even more complexity and unpredictability to concurrent programs.

Thus, it is highly recommended (by Apple) that Developers should try to ensure that priority inversions don‚Äôt occur in the first place, so the system isn‚Äôt forced to attempt a resolution.

Priority inversion is easy to avoid:
 - In general, don‚Äôt use different priorities.
 - If you need a higher QoS, use a different queue that with the desired QoS.
 - When you‚Äôre using GCD, always use the default priority queue (directly, or as a target queue)
