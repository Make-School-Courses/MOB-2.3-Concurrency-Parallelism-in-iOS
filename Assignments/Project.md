# Project Specifications

This term you'll work on a project in which you will put into practice the concepts learned in the course. This course covers complex topics that can be confusing to a large number of people. Your goal will be to demonstrate how you can create a working app using core concepts from the course. This time you will complement the project with a written delivery. This written assignment should document your project; explain the aim of the app, what was a problem you needed to solve and how you use some of the class concepts to solve it.

The *goal of the project* is to demonstrate your mastery in the course. To do so you can choose to include in your project as many concepts from the course as you feel comfortable with as long as they are applied in a correct manner. On the same note, you don't have to build something complex or with tons of features to pass this assignment. Think about the simplest way you can explain the material. (You can always build something more robust during an intensive)

## Requirements

- [x] The app's functionality is up to you. Any domain is good.
- [x] At least one feature of the app should be implemented using concepts from the course (see list below).
- [x] Even when the app might be simple, care about the UI/UX. Aim to get a professional looking app.
- [x] Write good code: use comments, follow a consistent style, document your work.
- [x] Written assignment should be well explained, using proper language, concepts correctly identified.


Bonus Points:
- [x] You publish your written assignment + working code in a blog post. (As learning material or tutorial)
- [X] You include good graphics (made by you) to the written assignment.
