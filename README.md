# MOB-2.3 - Concurrency & Parallelism in iOS

## Course Description
This course covers concurrency and parallelism in iOS to optimize programming performance on mobile devices built with multiple cores. Students will learn the foundation of Grand Central Dispatch and build applications that run multiple tasks simultaneously which improves speed.

## Prerequisites:  

[MOB 2.1](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-2.1-Local-Persistence-in-iOS)


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to ...

1. Define and distinguish concurrency from parallelism
1. Create delayed tasks, serial and concurrent queues
1. Identify deadlocks, race conditions and priority inversion in multi-threaded code
1. Practice common iOS interview projects & questions
1. Apply concepts in Grand Central Dispatch to use in projects

## Schedule

**NOTE:** Due to the shorter summer sessions, for some class sessions you will see multiple topics covered. This is to ensure that we cover the same material that we normally would in non-summer terms.

**Course Dates:** Tuesday, May 28 – Tuesday, July 2, 2019 (6 weeks)

**Class Times:** Tuesday and Thursday at 1:30–3:20pm (11 class sessions)
