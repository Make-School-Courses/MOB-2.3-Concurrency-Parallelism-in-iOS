# MOB-2.3 - Concurrency & Parallelism in iOS

## Course Description
This course covers concurrency and parallelism in iOS to optimize programming performance on mobile devices built with multiple cores. You will learn the foundation of Grand Central Dispatch, Operations and other tools to build applications that run multiple tasks simultaneously, optimizing resources.

## Prerequisites:
