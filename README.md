# MOB-2.3 - Concurrency & Parallelism in iOS

## Course Description
This course covers concurrency and parallelism in iOS to optimize programming performance on mobile devices built with multiple cores. You will learn the foundation of Grand Central Dispatch, Operations and other tools to build applications that run multiple tasks simultaneously, optimizing resources.

## Prerequisites:

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to ...

1. Define and distinguish concurrency from parallelism
1. Work with GCD Dispatch Queues and Operation Queues
1. Identify the most common pitfalls and challenges that come with concurrency.
1. Understand and apply Semaphores to solve synchronization problems.
1. Practice common iOS interview projects & questions
